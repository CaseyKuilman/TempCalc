# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I exclusively support the latest version of my project. Please check if you have the latest version as your testing version before reporting anything.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please send me an e-mail at caseykuilman01@gmail.com.
I will look into the vulnerability and seek to patch it. As soon as it is responsible to do so, I will give you feedback with regards to the vulnerability and/or its patching.
I unfortunately can't provide any financial reward(s) for discovering the vulnerability, but will happily credit you for finding it should you wish so.
If you have found a patch for the vulnerability in question, please include this in your message. This can lead to the security hole being patched faster.
